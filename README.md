# react-native-demo

## Before you Build ##
- Make sure the target device you're running on has the Expo app installed if its a physical device, which can be installed from App Store / Play Store
- If running on an iOS simulator / Android emulator, you shouln't need to do this, the expo app should install automatically

## Installing/Running ##
- Run `npm install` inside the root directory, in this case, '/react-native-demo'
- run `npm start` (or `expo start`)  inside same directory to initialize the expo developer tools in browser and start the project
Note: If for whatever reason the app fails to build/bundle, try deleting /node_modules and package-lock.json and running `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
